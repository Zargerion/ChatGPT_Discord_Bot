# Discord Bot for ChatGPT with Go
This is my first introduction to the language. Really intresting project. Learning not standart libraries only by learning sources on github is perfect practic to learn language.

## Downloading

So, now you need "git". If you haven't, google how to get (https://git-scm.com/book/ru/v2/%D0%92%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-Git).

Make a directory. In this directory using console write:

```git clone https://github.com/Zargerion/ChatGPT_Discord_Bot.git```

<ins> Of course you can simply download it to your created directory using grafic interface GitHub.com as you wish. </ins>

## Using

Come here to make an application for your discord server and get DISCORD_TOKEN: 
```https://discord.com/developers/applications```

Come here to get a GPT_API_KEY: 
```https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys```

Next you need go compiler. If you haven't, google how to get (https://go.dev/dl/). 

Use an IDE to change DISCORD_TOKEN and GPT_API_KEY in .env files. 

Run it in root using command in terminal: 
```go run main.go```

Or you can compile it for .exe file to execute.

Use!
